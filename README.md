# Studio Ghibli films selector

This application is a Studio Ghibli films selector web application where you can see all the information of the movies filmed by the studio with all kinds of interesting details such as the director, producer, what characters show in the films, and much more.

Even if this application is a side project made for learning purposes and is not a production website, it was created following a Hexagonal Architecture (also known as ports and adapters) and counts with some unit testing and UI components testing.

This application uses the [Studio Ghibli API](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/) backend, so all the credits for the API go to the creator.

If you have any recommendations or want to contribute, feel free to create a Pull Request.
